I am a Lecturer in the Department of Statistics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

I received my Ph.D. (2018) in Statistics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  I received a B.A. in Government and Computer Science from Claremont McKenna College. My research interests include causal inference, network analysis, computational methods, and statistical software. I also hold an M.A. in Political Science from UIUC and frequently draw inspiration for statistical applications from social science and public policy research questions.
